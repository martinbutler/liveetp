      <h3 class='page-header'>The Inspiration:</h3>
      <p>I was enjoying New Year's Eve with my wife from the comfort and warmth our home and thought of all those people that spent most of their day getting a great spot in Times Square to watch the ball drop.  We can always see the TV coverage, but I thought it would be cool to see what people were posting on their public Instagram feeds as they were posting them.</p>
      <p>I'm planing some updates in the near future and would love to get your feedback!<br> <a href="mailto:martinfullstack@gmail.com">Email Me</a></p>
